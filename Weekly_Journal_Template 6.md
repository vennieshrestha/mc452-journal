# Week 6: Building My Digital Foundation

**Date:** 02/21/2026
**Phase:** Architect 
**Approach Used:** Connector 

## Your Reflection

This week felt like we were building the foundation for everything we are going to do later in the semester. On Monday, when we talked about setting up the Digital Office, I did not realize how important organization would be for research. At first, it just felt like setting up folders and tools, but now I see that it is about creating a system that makes deeper thinking possible. Wednesday’s focus on Digital Identity also made me reflect on how I present myself academically online and how that connects to being a responsible researcher.

The Annotated Manuscript assignment using Zotero really tied everything together. Highlighting important sections of the research paper and tagging notes forced me to slow down and actually think about why certain ideas mattered. Instead of just reading passively, I had to ask myself how each highlighted part could connect to a larger research argument. It felt more interactive than just summarizing. Writing notes about why something was important made me more aware of how research articles are structured and how scholars support their claims.

This connects directly to my future project because learning to annotate properly will help me identify strong evidence and theoretical connections later on. I am starting to see research not just as reading information, but as entering a conversation. This week helped me understand that organization, digital tools, and careful annotation are not just technical tasks—they are skills that shape how effectively I can build my own academic work.

# Week 4: Catching Up with the Archivist Report

**Date:** February 11, 2026  
**Phase:** Analyst  
**Approach Used:** Troubleshooter

## Your Reflection

This week I’m using the _troubleshooter_ approach because I struggled a lot with the Archivist Report assignment in RStudio. I was absent during the week the class first went over it, so when I came back I felt behind and honestly pretty confused about where to even start. Opening the `.qmd` file, figuring out how to render it, and understanding why it wasn’t producing a PDF at first were all frustrating steps. It felt like I kept repeating the same process without getting the result I expected.

One of the main challenges was learning how RStudio works with Quarto files. I didn’t realize that you have to render the document properly for it to generate the final output, and that small errors in the code or setup can cause it to fail. At first I thought something was wrong with my computer, but after trying again, checking the instructions, and asking for help, I started to understand what each step was doing. Once the file rendered correctly and created the output folder, it made more sense how the system connects the script, the rendering process, and the final report.

Even though it was stressful to catch up after being absent, working through the assignment helped me become more comfortable with RStudio and the workflow of creating reports. I learned that troubleshooting in coding often requires patience and trying things step by step instead of assuming everything will work immediately. Going forward, I want to stay more up to date with class demonstrations and ask questions earlier so I don’t feel as lost. Overall, this challenge helped me build confidence in figuring things out even when I start off confused.

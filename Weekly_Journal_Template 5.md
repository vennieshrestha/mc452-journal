## Your Reflection

This week, we explored theory and literature in our course, and I found myself really connecting with the research side of things. Our assignment had us dive into Zotero, and it was exciting to see how a single tool can make finding and organizing articles and books so much easier. I’ve used research databases before, but Zotero made the whole process more streamlined, I could save sources, add notes, and even see my annotations all in one place. It made me think about how technology can transform research from something overwhelming into a manageable, even enjoyable, task.

I also realized that what we learned about theory this week ties directly into this process. Understanding the foundational concepts behind a topic isn’t just about reading, it’s about organizing knowledge so you can apply it later, whether in writing, projects, or discussions. Using Zotero helped me connect the dots between theory and practical application. By keeping track of sources and annotations, I could see how different ideas relate, which made the literature feel less abstract and more relevant to my work.

Overall, learning to use Zotero was both a practical and conceptual lesson. It reinforced the idea that tools and methods can support understanding, not just make tasks easier. I enjoyed experimenting with the app, exploring its features, and seeing how it can fit into my workflow. This week reminded me that even small skills, like mastering a new research tool, can create big connections between theory, practice, and my own learning process.

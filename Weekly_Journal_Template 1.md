# Week 1: [Navigating the course platform]

**Date:** [01/15/2026]
**Phase:** [Journalist]
**Approach Used:** [Troubleshooter]

## Your Reflection

[This week, my main challenge was getting set up with the tools we’ll use throughout the course, specifically the Obsidian app and GitHub. At first, downloading Obsidian and exploring its features, like linking notes and organizing folders, felt a bit confusing. Similarly, creating a GitHub account and enrolling in GitHub Education required careful attention to instructions, and I wasn’t sure I was completing everything correctly at first.]

[To overcome these challenges, I revisited tutorials, followed step-by-step guides, and even reached out to our professor for clarification. Doing this not only helped me resolve the issues but also allowed me to discover features I hadn’t noticed initially, such as creating repositories in GitHub Education and efficiently linking notes in Obsidian.]

[This troubleshooting process taught me that initial confusion is normal when learning new technology, and persistence combined with asking for help can turn that confusion into understanding. By the end of the week, I felt more confident navigating both tools and even developed strategies to keep myself organized as the semester progresses. Overall, this experience reinforced my ability to tackle technical challenges and reminded me that learning often involves problem-solving in real time.]

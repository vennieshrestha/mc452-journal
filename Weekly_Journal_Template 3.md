# Week 3: Snowed In, Still Learning

**Date:** January 30, 2026
**Phase:** Journalist 
**Approach Used:** Troubleshooter

This week was definitely more challenging than I expected because of the heavy snow. Due to the weather, I wasn’t able to attend the first day of class in person, which initially made me feel behind and a little stressed. Missing the first class is never ideal, especially when new software and assignments are introduced. However, this situation forced me to adapt quickly and find ways to stay on track despite the obstacles.

One of the biggest challenges this week was learning how to install R and RStudio on my own. At first, the process felt confusing because I had never worked with this type of software before. Between different download links, system requirements, and figuring out which version to install, it was easy to feel overwhelmed. I also worried that not being physically present in class would make it harder to understand what I was supposed to do.

To work through this, I relied on the course instructions, online resources, and patience. I carefully followed the step-by-step directions provided and took my time watching tutorials when I got stuck. After a few attempts, I successfully installed RStudio and was able to complete the assignment. Finishing the work despite the circumstances gave me a sense of accomplishment and confidence.

This experience taught me the importance of flexibility and problem-solving, especially in a course that involves technology. Even though the snow disrupted my plans, I still managed to learn new skills and complete my responsibilities. Overall, this week showed me that setbacks don’t have to stop progress if I’m willing to adapt and put in the effort.

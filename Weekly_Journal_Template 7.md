## Your Reflection

This week was more of a general midterm check-in where we reflected on how we’re doing in the class and submitted two formal Research Questions. The main challenge for me was narrowing my ideas into something specific and measurable. I had general interests and broad themes in mind, but turning those into structured questions using the required format was harder than I expected.

Writing my two RQs, using “How does Source X frame Topic Y?” and “What is the relationship between Variable A and Variable B?”, forced me to be more precise. I had to think carefully about what my actual source is and what variables I want to focus on. At first, my ideas felt too broad, and I wasn’t sure if they were clear enough.

However, after working through the structure, I feel more confident about my direction. The assignment helped me see that research is not just about having an interesting topic, but about asking focused questions that can actually be answered. Even though narrowing my focus was challenging, I think it was a necessary step in strengthening my project moving forward.
